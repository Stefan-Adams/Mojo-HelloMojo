# Mojo-HelloMojo
Mount All full and lite apps in the current directory

Mojolicious comes with a really great command line utility called `mojo`.  It's really simple to start up a Mojolicious webserver (`mojo daemon`) which is super useful for a lot of things.  The `hello_mojo` command is just an extension of `mojo` but instead of mounting a simple "Hello World" add, it mounts all of the apps in your current working directory or configured environment.
